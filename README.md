# What is this
This list contains plenty of resources regarding projects, libraries, assets, tutorials and other useful or recommended stuff by the NDD community.
Typically, you can find them by searching through our Discord channel, but I think that a general, grouped by category list is even more useful.  

As this list will probably grow in the future, you'll see more and more sections filled with verified and trusted resources that you can use to build your games or to improve your knowledge in a specific field.  

If you're external to this organization and want to add your own resources, just open a PR and we'll review them, to see if they can be suitable to be put in this list.
